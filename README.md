# Echo repiter ISD1820 and NE555

This device is an additional set-top box for portable radio stations (for Baofeng or Quansheng) and performs the function of an echo repeater.

The circuit is powered by a constant 5 volt and can be connected to a power bank (Since the set-top box consumes little energy, it is possible that the power bank will fall asleep).

Connects to the radio station through two jack connectors (2.5mm and 3.5mm)
